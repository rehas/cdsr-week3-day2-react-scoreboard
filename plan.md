### Note:
First start with what the app and components should do

1. Make Scoraboard Class
  1. Create the state prop for players
  2. Should be able to display scores
#
2. Make Player Class
    1. Create the state for the score
    2. propTypes implementation for name
    3. Player should be able to increment decrement score
#
3. Show them on App.js


#
# Proper Plan from Rein:

Setup react app 
  - ~~create react app~~

Make Scoreboard component
  - ~~Create new component (by copying and changing app.js)~~ 
  - ~~Simple render~~
  - ~~export~~
  - ~~import in app.js~~
  - ~~Test~~
  - ~~Make a state with players~~
  - ~~Render the player names (simple)~~
  - ~~Test~~
  - ~~Render Player components and pass them the name as a prop~~ 
  - ~~Test (should fail)~~

Make Player component
  - ~~Create new component (by copying and changing an existing component)~~ 
  - ~~Simple render~~
  - ~~export~~
  - ~~import in app.js~~
  - ~~Test~~
  - ~~Use the prop name in the render~~
  - ~~Test~~
  - ~~Proptypes~~
  - ~~Make a state with score~~
  - ~~Render score in player~~
  - ~~Test~~
  - Make an increment function
  - Make an event listener
  - Test
  - Make an decrement function
  - Make an event listener
  - Test
  - Celebrate!
